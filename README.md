# Price-Prediction-Based-on-BTC-Price

I found out that most of the time, price of ETH and other coins would follow the price movement of BTC and there is appearantly a time-lag in between. This could be a good chance of arbitrage trading if you are calculating your ROI in BTC. 
I used time series analysis and LTSM (RNN) method to predict the price of ETH in co-movement. The result seems to be good but still need more research in it.
